# ðŸ“ˆ Financial Data Extraction using Alpha Vantage API

This notebook demonstrates how to retrieve **real-time and historical financial data** using the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/). The goal of this project is to automate data collection for use in downstream tasks such as time series forecasting, financial modeling, or sentiment-driven analysis.

---

## ðŸ§¾ What This Project Does

- Connects to the Alpha Vantage API using an API key
- Fetches **stock time series data** (e.g., daily OHLC data)
- Converts the API response into a structured Pandas DataFrame
- Handles API limitations like throttling and missing responses
- Prepares the data for further analysis or modeling

This setup can be reused across multiple stocks, time intervals, and adjusted for different types of financial metrics (intraday, technical indicators, etc.).
